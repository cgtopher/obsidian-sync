## Executive Summary

*In order to enable the creation of complex workflows that are dependent on state, this proposes the use of Camunda's Workflow Engine. A library provided by Camunda that uses Business Process Management Notation (BPMN) to define the "paths" a form can take*

## Background

Historically in this company, a home-brewed rules engine has been used along with a JSON form definition that 

## Proposed Implementation


*Consider:*

- *using diagrams to help illustrate your ideas.*
- *including code examples if you're proposing an interface or system contract.*
- *linking to project briefs or wireframes that are relevant.*

## Metrics & Dashboards

*What are the main metrics we should be measuring? For example, when interacting with an external system, it might be the external system latency. When adding a new table, how fast would it fill up?*

## Drawbacks

*Are there any reasons why we should not do this? Here we aim to evaluate risk and check ourselves.*

## Alternatives

*What are other ways of achieving the same outcome?*

## Potential Impact and Dependencies

*Here, we aim to be mindful of our environment and generate empathy towards others who may be impacted by our decisions.*

- *What other systems or teams are affected by this proposal?*
- *How could this be exploited by malicious attackers?*

## Unresolved questions

*What parts of the proposal are still being defined or not covered by this proposal?*

## Conclusion

*Here, we briefly outline why this is the right decision to make at this time and move forward!*
